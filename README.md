# KiCAD-Components
A public release of KiCAD component schematics and footprints that have been created primarily with the intent of personal use. An effort is made to include reference images to provide indication of the resulting product. These are made available and may, in-time, be submitted as a merge candidates to the make KiCAD repository.
